 employees are all JOINS

 mySql2 functionality breaks with .then import the .promise() const mysql = require ('mysq12/promise');
 mysql breaks the code sometimes inside the inquirer.then

 1. create databases, create seed data.
 2. set up 1 inquire message that lets you view by employees
    - view all departments SELECT * FROM departments;
    - view all roles ref queries.sql
    - view all employees SELECT * FROM employees;
    - add a department
    - add a role
    - add an employee
    - update an employee role
