# human-resources-tracker
## Description

This is a Content Manager System app to track employees of a company and my first time using SQL infrastructure with javascript.

- My biggest motivation was to provide companies the ability to effectively track their employees, departments and roles within a company.
- While working in the back-end SQL is one option when storing and retrieving data, this was a first take to gain this skill-set.
- This app allows company management to seemlessly view store and update company human resources information
- While working on this app, using node I used four npm packages, and integrated javascript with SQL
